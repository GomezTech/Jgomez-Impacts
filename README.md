# Impacts on Soceity
Impacts Plan for Summer Computer Science Course 2023
My course, Coding with Minecraft, is a middle school 6-8 grade computer science course that I will be offering my studnets over 3 weeks for summer vacation. This enrichment opportunity will be a great way to help my students learn the basics of coding through scracth block coding, in addtion students will be using a minecraft software that is designed to incoporate gaming into learning. Piper computers allow students to its minecraft built in software that provides students with a virtual world that applies coding concepts. Students that will be served in the this summer program come from various learning backgrounds,including students with 504's and students on IEP. The goal of this summer program to have fun while learning skills needed to get a base understanding of coding. Students 

# Learning Objectives
Studnets will be able to identify and name the impacts of computing in society as it relates to todays youth. 

Students will solve problems that are presented throught the computer piper curriculum. 

Students will analyze real world problems of computers in society, both postive/negative impacts.

Students will organize the codes to create solutions to basic coding fuctions.

Students will discuss and show how codes work in the program

Students will build the piper computer and program the computer to run its basic commands. 

#Learning Abilities

The biggest objective for the this summer course is to excite students in computer sciecne. Because this is a summer course I want my students to have a more hands on exepriance and feel less like the regular school year. Students will be hands on and asks to work on the curriculum throught scracth and piper computer, there will some writing requirements for reflection. 

Students will be asked to write down a weekly question that targets a idea of the week. As reflection each day students will add to their answer, at the end of the week, I will ask students to share and discuss their responses. 

Students will have to build the piper computer with their partners in this hands on apporach. Students will build and assemble the hardware that will boot up the software through piper. No wifi needed the program allows students to use minecraft to build the computer in a virtual setting while learning coding along the way. 

Once the computer is built and ready to go, students will be assigned lessons that focus on different concepts of coding. I want my students to collaborate and find solutions to their problems they are assigned. I will ask students to help other pairs. Students will be ask to share whole class their solutions with other students and we will have a discussion on how we were able to find these solutions. 

Another activity that I plan for my students to do is analyze the positive/harmful impacts of computers in thier soceity. There are many videos on youtube that discuss this, but I want my students to work towards breaking down the perscpectives. I will ask students to create a mini presentation on which they will have the freedom of choice to share either the postive impacts of computers or the harmful impacts of computers. As a twist I will ask students to record their analyis through flip grid to take the pressue of a formal presentation. This will support my students on IEPs and provide them with an extra choice on how to complete this assignment. The goal for this assignment is to provide knowledge of how computers fit in their worlds. 

Students will also be provided with opportunites to create games through scrach coding. My students will be given a objective to create a game such as pacman, and will be provided resources to generate ideas on how they will create this game. 

#Assessment

The students progress toward these goals will be meassured through thier discussions. I will use the weekly question to assess how they understand the idea of the week. 
For the presentation they will be graded on how they were able to connect the idea of either positive/negative impacts with reasons and some good evidence to help their claim. I will use a rubric that meassures claim/evidence and reasoning to support and idea. 
Through the lessons in the piper computer, students will be allowed to move on to the next activity as they complete each individual problem and objective. I will monitor the progress as students move on, for students who struggle I will ask students who have completed this task to help them. I will encoruage students to teach each other and treat this and a informal observation of their own understanding of the coding process. 
Lastly, the minecraft applicaiton allows this virtual world to show how compoents of a computer are connected and worked. The biggest reason why I am using this program is I want my students to be able to show me thier work through this virutal plan. A 3d renderring is just an amazing way to show ideas/understanding. 

#Outcomes
The biggest goal is that I want my students to get excited about computer science. To support equity in my classroom Students will be sharing a piper computer to work along side each other. In addtion students will also be given a google chromebook for a 1 to 1 ratio. This will allow students to be able to explore assignments at home. 
Through the discussions and video presentations, I want my students to take way how computers/technology impacts their everyday life. Students will have a better underanding and be more mindful of their responsibility with navigating the harmful impacts of computers, while embracing the positves. More importantly, I want my studens who are from a rural community to feel like they have a place in the computer world. For example, I want my students to feel inspired to pursue further understanding of coding and creating games.
